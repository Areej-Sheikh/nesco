              Leadership at Nesco is more than just management, it is a principle. Our founder, J. V. Patel was a first-generation industrialist in independent India and a peerless entrepreneur. He carved a niche for himself in the industrial and business realm by dint of technical know-how, meticulousness, diligence and leadership. The investiture of his beliefs in our teams is what takes us forward as a company. Across our diverse industries, our capabilities at Nesco are expanding. As businesses grow, the focus of our leadership grows on converting the credo of believe into action.
